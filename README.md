If you want to know more about the architecture you can read their blog [here](https://blog.mindorks.com/essential-guide-for-designing-your-android-app-architecture-mvp-part-2-b2ac6f3f9637). There are several differences from the original architecture in this project such as, in this project i use Realm instead of greenDao.

Then generate your new project:

```bash

After done creating the project, open the project in Android Studio and wait until gradle finish its build. Because the project use Dagger as dependency injection, you have to make the project first by going to **Build** -> **Make Project**.
